small-dataset is the subset of large archive of images used for test.

we have N = 1000 images converted to features.

small.features.json is an array with N vectors.
vector is a 192 dimensional feature of a picture.

block-features/ represents 10 larger images with features calculated in grid.
grid is 32x32=1024 subpictures. each subpicture is represented by 192
dimensional feature of a picture.

small-bmp/ contains first N images that corresponds to N vectors in
small.features.json

node make-index.js will create index that will be loadable with
'../lib/load-index.js'.

test index.js is pushed to repository.
